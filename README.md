# File-Compression-Project-CPP-

This Project is Based on DSA(TOPIC:- Huffman Coding)
NOTE:- This Project is under Development!
But manually we can give the path of the text file into the code and execute it!
Now, i have to modify this project so that, user can give the path of text file through the console window And can use the feature of compressed and decompressed text file.
After that, I have to implement another feature which can be used to check whether this software can decompressed the given compressed file or Not. Bcoz: Only those file will be decompressed which is compressed by this software. Now, also this thing is happend. But i think, i can use the some concept of cryptography to make this project amazing!
You can download this software after all the feature is implemented and You can use it to do decompressed and compressed text.
